This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. These lessons can be taught in half of a day. They start with some
basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to
import CSV files, the structure of a data frame, how to deal with factors, how to
add/remove rows and columns, and finish with how to calculate summary statistics
for each level and a very brief introduction to plotting.
