## The R syntax

_Start by showing an example of a script_

* Point to the different parts:
  - a function
  - the assignment operator `<-`
  - the `=` for arguments
  - the comments `#` and how they are used to document function and its content
  - the `$` operator
* Point to indentation and consistency in spacing to improve clarity

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)

#' Convert a zone-to-zone record of trucks into a trip table.
#'
#' @param trucks A data frame of truck plans, from TAZ i to TAZ j. Also includes
#'   truck class.
#' @param taz A vector containing all i.
#'
#' @return a data frame with i, j, and volume by class.
#'
#' @import dplyr
#' @import tidyr
#'
sum_to_taz <- function(x){

  x <- x %>%
    # determine if truck is MU or SU
    mutate(class = ifelse(grepl("SU", config), "SU", "MU")) %>%

    # Add up to i, j, by class
    group_by(origin, destination, class) %>%
    summarise(n = n()) %>%

    # spread across types
    spread(class, n, fill = 0)

  return(x)
}


trucks <- read_csv("county_plans.csv", col_types = "ccccc")  %>%
  sum_to_taz()

write_csv(trucks, "county_od_config.csv")
```




### Creating objects

You can get output from R simply by typing in math in the console

```{r, purl=FALSE}
3 + 5
12/7
```

However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign _values_ to
_objects_. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the
assignment operator `<-`, and the value we want to give it:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55
```

Objects can be given any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or
`subject_id`. You want your object names to be explicit and not too long. They
cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid, but `x2` is). R is case sensitive
(e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`). There are some names that
cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g.,
`if`, `else`, `for`, see
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)
for a complete list). In general, even if it's allowed, it's best to not use
other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`). In doubt
check the help to see if the name is already in use. It's also best to avoid
dots (`.`) within a variable name as in `my.dataset`. There are many functions
in R with dots in their names for historical reasons, but because dots have a
special meaning in R (for methods) and other programming languages, it's best to
avoid them. It is also recommended to use nouns for variable names, and verbs
for function names. It's important to be consistent in the styling of your code
(where you put spaces, how you name variable, etc.). In R, two popular style
guides are [Hadley Wickham's](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) and
[Google's](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml).

When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force to
print the value by using parentheses or by typing the name:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object
```

Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For
instance, we may want to convert this weight in pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2
times the weight in kg):

```{r, purl=FALSE}
2.2 * weight_kg
```

We can also change a variable's value by assigning it a new one:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

This means that assigning a value to one variable does not change the values of
other variables.  For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new
variable, `weight_lb`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 200?


R objects can refer to more than single values. Other common objects are
*functions*, *vectors*, *lists*, *data frames*, and many others. In today's lesson
we will talk mostly about vectors and data frames.


### Vectors

A vector is a set of values of a common type. You can create a vector with the
`c` function. You can examine the structure of an object with the `str` function.

```{r}
a <- c(100, 80, 90)
a
str(a)
```

If you mix types, then the vector will default to a common type. *Question*: Why
are there quotes around the values?

```{r}
a_character <- c(100, 80, "90")
a_character
str(a_character)
```

If you have a vector of data that you want to be numeric but it is read in
as characters, you can change it to numeric.

```{r}
as.numeric(a_character)
```

If you have a field that cannot be turned into a numeric value, it becomes
the missing value `NA`. One of R's advantages over other programming languages
is that it supports missing values.
```{r}
as.numeric(c(100, 80, "ninety"))
```

Most statistical functions in R apply to vectors, like `sum` and `length`

```{r}
sum(a)
length(a)
```

We can write our own functions, too.

```{r }
average <- function(x){
  sum(x) / length(x)
}

average(a)
```

Of course, there's a `mean` function already defined that we should use instead
of writing our own...

```{r}
mean(a)
```

Note that if there is an `NA` value in your vector, then `mean` will by default
return `NA`. You can exclude these values by saying `na.rm = TRUE`

```{r}
mean(c(5, 7, 4, NA))
mean(c(5, 7, 4, NA), na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Data frames

A data frame is a list of vectors that must be of the same length. This object
works like tabular data you have used before.

```{r}
d <- data.frame(
  name = c(1, 2, 3),
  value = c(72, 34, 85)
)

d
str(d)
```

You can do operations on single vector elements from a data frame with the `$`
selection operator.

```{r}
mean(d$value)
```


Most data frames aren't created by a user, but are read in from tabular data.
To explore data frames more effectively with some real-world data examples, we'll
want to load a couple of *packages* first.

## R Packages
Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do more
stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `str()` or `mean()`,
come built into R; packages give you access thousands of functions that have been
written by programmers and scientists around the world. Before you use a
package for the first time you need to install it on your machine. You
should have already installed the [`tidyverse`](http://tidyverse.org/)
collection of packages; if you have not, you can do so with the following
command:

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

You might get asked to choose a CRAN mirror -- this is basically asking you to
choose a site to download the package from. The choice doesn't matter too much;
we recommend the RStudio mirror. The tidyverse actually contains a number of
packages, including the ones we will use in this lab:

`readr` contains functions to read tabular data (like `.csv` files) into your
working environment as a data frame.
`dplyr` contains functions for manipulating data frames.
R already contains functions to do both of these things in the `base` package,
which we've been exploring so far. These packages have several improvements over
`base` functions, however:

  - Computationally expensive operations are programmed in C++, so the functions
  in these libraries are (really, really) fast.
  - The syntax for using functions in these packages is clear and easy to write.
  This also makes it easy to read.
  - Some relics of R that can be annoying in some contexts are avoided.

In order to use functions in a package, you need to load it from your library.

```{r, message = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


## readr

Download the data for this lesson:
[nhts_per.csv](http://psrc.github.io/itm-tutorial-R/data/nhts_per.csv). Place
this csv file in your project's `data/` folder. Then read
it into your workspace with `read_csv`. These are real NHTS person records, but with
only the first 200 individuals for expediency.

```{r}
nhts_per <- read_csv("data/nhts_per.csv")
nhts_per
```

When you print a data frame that you loaded with `read_csv` and `dplyr`, it will
show you how many rows are in the data, and the names and types of all the
variables. Additionally, RStudio is equipped with a function that will allow you
to explore a data frame interactively.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(nhts_per)
```

## dplyr

Now that we have a data_frame in our workspace, we're going to learn some of the
most common `dplyr` functions: `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`,
and `summarize()`. To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first
argument to this function is the data frame (`surveys`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
select(nhts_per, HOUSEID,  HHSIZE, HHVEHCNT, USEPUBTR)
```

To choose rows, use `filter()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
filter(nhts_per, USEPUBTR == "01")
```

How can you tell that this changed?

### Pipes

But what if you wanted to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes. With the
intermediate steps, you essentially create a temporary data frame and use that
as input to the next function. This can clutter up your workspace with lots of
objects. You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another).
This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested as
the process from inside out. The last option, pipes, are a fairly recent
addition to R. Pipes let you take the output of one function and send it
directly to the next, which is useful when you need to many things to the same
data set.  Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the `magrittr`
package installed as part of `dplyr`.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
nhts_per %>%
  filter(USEPUBTR == "01") %>%
  select(HOUSEID, PERSONID, HHSIZE, HHVEHCNT, USEPUBTR)
```

In the above we use the pipe to send the `nhts_per` data set first through
`filter`, to keep rows where `USEPUBTR` was `01`, and then through `select` to
keep the household size, vehicles, and public transit columns. When the data
frame is being passed to the `filter()` and `select()` functions through a pipe,
we don't need to include it as an argument to these functions anymore.

If we wanted to create a new object with this smaller version of the data we
could do so by assigning it a new name:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
use_transit <- nhts_per %>%
  filter(USEPUBTR == "01") %>%
  select(HOUSEID, PERSONID, HHSIZE, HHVEHCNT, USEPUBTR)
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

> ### Challenge {.challenge}
>
>  Using pipes, subset the data to include people 18 and older  who live in households
where the number of vehicles is less than the number of adults. (`R_AGE` is the
age of the individual.)

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
## Answer
nhts_per %>%
    filter(R_AGE >= 18) %>%
    filter(HHVEHCNT < NUMADLT)
```


### Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions, or find the ratio of values in two
columns. For this use `mutate()`.

To create a new column which is a logical value if the person used public transit,


```{r, purl = FALSE}
nhts_per %>%
  mutate(use_transit = ifelse(USEPUBTR == "01", TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  select(HOUSEID, PERSONID, use_transit)

```

Because most of these are `FALSE`, we can use `filter` to zero in on them. Note
that because `use_transit` is logical, we don't need to be explicit about what
we are filtering.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
nhts_per %>%
  mutate(use_transit = ifelse(USEPUBTR == "01", TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  filter(use_transit) %>%
  select(HOUSEID, PERSONID, use_transit)
```

You can negate any R function with the `!` symbol. If we wanted non-transit
users, we could do this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
nhts_per %>%
  mutate(use_transit = ifelse(USEPUBTR == "01", TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  filter(!use_transit) %>%
  select(HOUSEID, PERSONID, use_transit)
```

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the "split-apply-combine"
paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and
then combine the results. `dplyr` makes this very easy through the use of the
`group_by()` function. `group_by()` splits the data into groups upon which some
operations can be run. For example, if we wanted to find how many people were in
each household and their average age,


```{r, purl = FALSE}
nhts_per %>%
  group_by(HOUSEID) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_age = mean(R_AGE),
    number_people = n()
  )
```


You can group by multiple columns too:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
nhts_per %>%
  group_by(HHSIZE, HHVEHCNT) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    weighted_n = sum(WTPERFIN)
  )
```
